# ATM-NoTrans

This is an attempt to code an ATM Bank Machine using OOP concept and Python.
In this project the "Customer", "Account" and "Bank" classes are created. The "Main" file  presents the UI for the user interaction with the system. The "Datasource" file provides the interface layer where the Main utilizes the functionions defined in Bank class.
The project is fully operational and provides the following functions expected from an ATM Machine (and more!!):
1. List All Existing Customers
2. Search For A Customer
3. Add New Customer
4. Update Customer Information (Name)
5. Delete Customer
6. Create Account
7. Preform Deposit / Withdraw Transactions
8. Terminate Account
9. Exit the ATM

Social Security Number (PNR) is used for identifying existing customer / creating customers and for subsequent account creation, account transactions and account termination.

NOTE: This project is a prototype and experimental code. If you want to use it read the code thoroughly and use it at your own risk.
